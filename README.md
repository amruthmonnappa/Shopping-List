A simple web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that demonstrates fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This project is designed to help users create, manage, and organize their shopping lists in a simple and intuitive way.

Features
  - Add New Items: Users can add items to the shopping list.
  - Read Existing Items: The list of items is displayed dynamically on the page.
  - Update Items: Users can modify items they have already added.
  - Delete Items: Users can remove items from the list.
  - Persistent Data: Data is saved in local storage, so the list remains available even after the browser is refreshed.
